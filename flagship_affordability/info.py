These hypothetical scenarios are meant to help the user explore how NASA Astrophysics 
funding might be able to support three long-lived flagship observatories that operate 
simultaneously. Hubble, Spitzer, and Chandra have amply demonstrated the power of multiwavelength 
flagships teaming up for scientific discovery. 
<br> 
<br> 
The launch years of each mission are marked by the inverted triangles, 
and the horizontal bars show each mission's operational lifetime. These can be any 
missions you like, in any order, at any price. The "Years of Simultaneous Operation" 
reported measures the number of years from the launch of Mission 3 to the end of 
Mission 1's operational lifetime, during which all three Observatories are available. The basic assumptions are:
<br>(1) the initial 'flagship wedge is the current sum of WFIRST + JWST ($700 M in FY20).
<br>(2) the new 'flagship wedge' controlled by the slider begins in 2026. 
<br>(3) the current wedge for the "rest of APD", not including JWST and WFIRST development costs, remains constant at $700M. 
<br>(4) the hypothetical "Probe Wedge" is held at a constant $150M / year. 
<br>(5) each colored mission wedge shows the construction costs - operational costs for all missions are held within the "APD" wedge. 
<br>(5) all calculations are done in constant, FY20 dollars without inflation. This is appropriate for considering total costs estimated in current year dollars against available budgets in the same currency.

<br><br> 

The starting point at 2020 corresponds approximately to the current 
Astrophysics division and its flaghsips currently in development. 
The light grey "APD" wedge covers (approximately) all APD programs 
apart from the two flagships. This $700M wedge is held fixed throughout. 
The "out years" after the M3 launch are, of course, highly uncertain, 
so we do not speculate about what will happen there except to retain 
the "rest of APD" wedge.
